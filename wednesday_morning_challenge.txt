# Wednesday Morning Challenge

Create a playbook to run against the planetexpress hosts that does the following:

- uses the following vars_files named "myvars.yml"
    
    commands:
    - ls
    - echo $HOME $PWD > myfile.txt
    - cat myfile.txt

	
- apt installs cowsay on any host with ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
- yum installs cowsay on any host with ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
- performs each of the commands from the "myvars.yml" file in a loop
